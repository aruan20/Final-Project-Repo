  <h1> Do you want to play with the angels too? </h1>
  <h3 style="color:red"> Warning: Blood, murder, mariticide, suicide, kidnapping, generally messed up themes, all you need to know is that he’s a psycho and you need to complete the challenge to find out where his newest victim is being held so that they can be rescued by the police. Maybe don’t read this if you don’t like blood and darker stories. :/ I warned you.</h3>

    It was that time of the year again. Soft flakes drifted down from the sky to the white ground, as people treaded across the compressed snow. As he walked down Blueberry Street, he could see beautiful lights decorating the windows of bakeries and gift shops and Christmas trees of all sizes placed outside the front doors. He pushed open the door to Cream ’N Puff and was immediately greeted with the smell of freshly-baked bread and cookies. For a Saturday afternoon, the bakery was full of people ordering last-minute presents, families taking a break to satisfy their sweet tooth, and couples having a date amidst the holiday joy.
  </p>
  <p>
    “What do you mean you canceled our vacation? You promised that we would go with the kids during winter break and now you decided for all of us that we’re not going to go because some distant relative of yours is coming over? What the hell?!”
  </p>
  <p>
    He looked around. It was the couple standing near the entrance who were yelling.
  </p>
  <p>
    “— oh stop making a ruckus! We can always go to Disneyland next year. What’s the big deal?”
  </p>
  <p>
    “What’s the big deal? You said that we’ll go for the past five years! And did we go once? No! You just kept pushing it back and back! It’s like all those days you said you’ll come home for dinner and I won’t see you until 12 AM! At least tell me in advance! Not the f—ing day before!”
  </p>
  <p>
    His hand clenched tightly around his cup of hot chocolate.
  </p>
  <p>
    “— you need to spend more time with your son!” <i>“You need to spend more time with your son!”</i>
  </p>
  <p>
    “Excuse me? I spend all my time working so that you guys can live a comfortable life. I don’t need you controlling the only other free time I have!” <i>“Stop breathing down my neck! I can do whatever I want during my free time! You should be grateful that I’m earning money for the family, unlike you who just laze around in the house doing nothing.” </i>
  </p>
  <p>
    “What? You were the one who insisted all those years ago that I stay at home and take care of our child!” <i>“You were the one who insisted that I stay home! What nonsense are you spouting now?”</i>
  </p>
  <i>
  <p>
    They both stood there, glaring at each other as they took in deep breaths.
  </p>
  <p>
    “Who is she?”
  </p>
  <p>
    “What do you mean?”
  </p>
  <p>
    “You know who I’m talking about. The girl you were with yesterday at the park.”
  </p>
  <p>
    “…how much did you see?”
  </p>
  <p>
    She laughed. “What didn’t I see?” She walked into the kitchen and came out, holding something behind her back. “Do you remember when we made our vows? I said that I was head over heels in love and that I would do anything for our love.”
  </p>
  <p>
    Her hand came out from behind her back and the blade glinted in the light. “Anything.”
  </p>
  <p>
    His eyes widened. “No…no no no. You’re not.” He started backing up but she was already right against his face, pushing the blade into his rapidly beating heart.
  </p>
  <p>
    “If I can’t have you, then no one else can.” She wrenched her arm back and smirked as the blood dripped down.
  </p>
  <p>
    “Mommy?” panicked she spun around, only to see a small boy silently sobbing as he clutched his glass of milk.
  </p>
  <p>
    “Oh, sweetie.” She rushed over to the boy, hugging him close as he tried to push her away.
  </p>
  <p>
    With one final push, the child escaped her arms and waddled over to the rapidly cooling body on the floor. “Daddy?” he asked, shaking the corpse.
  </p>
  <p>
    “Sweetie he’s gone. You know how I told you when someone dies they go to rest with the angels? Well Daddy’s gone to rest with the red angels.”
  </p>
  <p>
    “No no Mommy, look. Daddy’s still alive!” While saying this, the child reached into the open wound, slid his small arm into the corpse’s arm, and waved it at his mother.
  </p>
  <p>
    “What have I done?” she asked. She stared down at her trembling blood-soaked hands.
  </p>
  <p>
    “I can fix this, I’ll just remove myself from the equation. He’ll be better off without me.” She looked at her son. “I do this because I love you.” And with one swipe of the knife another body hit the floor.
  </p>
  <p>
    “I love you too. Mommy? Where’d you go? Mommy did you go play with the angels too?” He started panicking and wailed, “Why did you leave me behind?” He shook his little head. “No no mommy said she loved me, this is what people do when they love you.”
  </p>
  <p>
    He was later found sitting between the two bodies, clutching his glass of red-tinged milk. Rocking back and forth, he muttered “Mommy loved me, that's why she had to do it” over and over again.

  <p>
    Abruptly startled back into the present by a cup shattering against the linoleum floor, he jerked upright.
  </p>
  <p>
    “Hey mister, you spilled your drink all over your hands.”
  </p>
  <p>
    “Thanks kid. How ‘bout I buy you a cookie to go with that glass of milk ya got there?”
  </p>
  <p>
    “No thanks, my mom said to not accept things from strangers.”
  </p>
  <p>
    “Well where’s your mom?”
  </p>
  <p>
    “She’s arguing with my dad over there.”
  </p>
  <p>
    “Sorry kid, if it makes you feel better, my parents used to argue all the time too. My name is Tom, what’s yours?”
  </p>
  <p>
    “My name is Tommy.”
  </p>
  <p>
    “Well look at that, we’re not strangers anymore. So, whaddya say kid? Want an extra large chocolate chip cookie?”
  </p>
  <p>
    “Ok mister.”
  </p>
  <p>
    Tommy slipped his hand into the man’s grasp, and followed Tom out the door.
  </p>
  <p>
    While Tommy left with the stranger, Tommy’s parents were still arguing.
  </p>
  <p>
    By then, half of the customers had already left, unable to enjoy their time with the annoying bickering in the background. It took the employees at least ten minutes to break up the fight and they were then asked to leave.
  </p>
  <p>
    “Tommy, it’s time to go.” Looking around for him she turned to and fro. “Honestly Herschel, he learned this kind of behavior from you. Always wandering to and fro without a care in the world.”
  </p>
  <p>
    “Don’t start with me Felicia, none of this would have happened if you hadn’t started ragging on me like usual.”
  </p>
  <p>
    Starting to panic, Felicia called out, “Has anyone seen a 7 year old boy? He was holding a glass of milk and about 4 foot 2.” As everyone responded in the negative, Herschel also began to panic.
  </p>
  <p>
    “I’m sure he’s somewhere around here, Felicia. He couldn’t have gone far.”
  </p>
  <p>
    “What was he wearing?” Someone called out.
  </p>
  <p>
    “Uh- a red sweater..?”
  </p>
  <p>
    “Honestly Herschel, do you ever pay attention to your child? He was wearing black pants and a <i>blue</i> T-shirt.” Glaring at him, she scanned the crowd for her baby.
  </p>
  <p>
    “Hey lady, I dunno about a blue shirt but some kid wearing red and black walked outta here with a mister about 10 minutes ago.”
  </p>
  <p>
    Shooting Felicia a smug grin, Herschel turned towards the customer. “Was it this boy right here?” He showed the customer a picture of Tommy smiling at the camera as he held onto his birthday balloons.
  </p>
  <p>
    “Yea I’m sure. That was him.”
  </p>
  <p>
    “Oh my poor baby,” Felicia cried. “We need to call the police!”
  </p>
  <p>
    By the time the police arrived, Felicia and Herschel were back to arguing again. The bakery employees informed the officers as to what had happened, who then left to search the nearby premises to no avail. No one knew where Tommy was and no one knew what to do.
