  <h1> Do you want to play with the angels too? </h1>
  <h3 style="color:red"> Warning: Blood, murder, matricide/mariticide, kidnapping, generally messed up themes, all you need to know is that he’s a psycho and you need to complete the challenge to find out where his newest victim is being held so that they can be rescued by the police.

    It was that time of the year again. Soft flakes drifted down from the sky to the white ground, as people treaded across the compressed snow. As he walked down Blueberry Street, he could see beautiful lights decorating the windows of bakeries and gift shops and Christmas trees of all sizes placed outside the front doors. He pushed open the door to Cream ’N Puff and was immediately greeted with the smell of freshly-baked bread and cookies. For a Saturday afternoon, the bakery was full of people ordering last-minute presents, families taking a break to satisfy their sweet tooth, and couples having a date amidst the holiday joy.

    “Excuse me? I spend all my time working so that you guys can live a comfortable life. I don’t need you controlling the only other free time I have!” <i>“Stop breathing down my neck! I can do whatever I want during my free time! You should be grateful that I’m earning money for the family, unlike you who just laze around in the house doing nothing.” </i>
  </p>
  <p>
    “What? You were the one who insisted all those years ago that I stay at home and take care of our child!” <i>“You were the one who insisted that I stay home! What nonsense are you spouting now?”</i>
